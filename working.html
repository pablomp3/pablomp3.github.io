							<h1 class="major">Working abroad</h1>
							<p>
								Entering the labor force for the first time is challenging enough by itself, but doing so in a foreign country adds an extra
								difficulty hard to describe. A feeling of uncertainty may sometimes come (e.g. 'is this place where I want to be?' or 'is this what I want to do?'
								could resonate with you), which I believe is completely normal, plus overcoming those confusing moments will make you wiser.
								If you are interested in working outside your home country, I'm glad to share a few thoughts with you.

							<h3>Advice #1:</h3>
							<blockquote>
								Go study to the country where you see yourself working at.
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								If you already know the place you'd love to work at after graduating (which isn't that easy to figure out), this is the action that will
								put you directly on the most ideal spot to achieve that goal.
								Going back a few years, when I was in my last year of university, I asked a professor I had good relationship with for advice - Should I go to graduate
								school? Should it be in a foreign country? My professor, who had knew for a while my interest in other cultures and my tendency for
								exploration, after persuading me to pursuing a Master's degree, gave me this advice: "<mark>go study to the country where you see yourself working at</mark>".
								<br />
								In that moment, I thought it was nuts. After graduating, I could go anywhere I wanted, right? Theoretically, it's a possibility,
								but in practice (and it has been especially proven after the covid pandemic), switching job markets without prior working experience
								is not an easy task.
							</p>
							<hr />
							<h3>Advice #2: Look for a scholarship</h3>
							<p>
								The second advice that I want to share is: <mark>please, look for a scholarship</mark>. A bunch of European countries with reputed universities have no
								tuition for European students (Denmark, Germany, Sweden, etc) and sometimes this is true even for students from outside Europe (this sadly depends on
								each university). But, on top of that, there are a lot of great scholarships funded by local goverments. Do a quick research based on the
								countries/programs you are interested. Some scholarships require an exceptional record, but others are not as competitive, as they are fairly
								unknown outside their student niche.
